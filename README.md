Features
This application includes a variety of features to enhance productivity and user experience:

Personalized Welcome: The app starts with a welcome screen that asks for the user's name. The name is then used to personalize the app's title.

Data Persistence: The user's name and all tasks are saved to localStorage, ensuring data is preserved between browser sessions.

Full Task Management:

Create new tasks with a description, an optional due date, and a time.

Mark tasks as complete or active by clicking on them.

Remove all completed tasks with the "Clear Completed" button.

Dynamic Filtering: Users can filter the task list to view "All", "Active", or "Completed" tasks.

Task Counter: A counter displays the number of active items remaining.

Empty State: A helpful message appears when the task list is empty, guiding the user to add a new task.

Modern Neumorphic UI: The interface is styled with a soft, tactile design using Neumorphic and Glassmorphic principles.

Smooth Animations: Tasks are removed with a subtle fade-out animation for a better user experience.
